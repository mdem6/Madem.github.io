    <h1>Reflections on SIGCSE's Review Process and Systemic Biases</h1>

    <div class="thesis">
        <strong>The SIGCSE review process mirrors larger societal biases</strong>, particularly in academic circles, by often reflecting an echo chamber that reinforces existing power structures and marginalizes diverse perspectives.
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        <strong>Does the existing method take into account the diversity of perspectives and experiences sufficiently?</strong> The rejection of Dr. Washington's panel proposal indicates that the evaluation process should be more transparent.
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        The experiences of Dr. Washington cast doubt on SIGCSE's commitment to diversity. <strong>How can academic communities ensure that different viewpoints are respected and included simultaneously?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        The response to Dr. Washington’s submission indicates a potential underappreciation or misunderstanding of DEI initiatives. <strong>What does this indicate about CS education's dedication to diversity?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        Dr. Washington highlights the paradox of claiming to support diversity while rejecting panels aimed at broadening participation. <strong>How can SIGCSE align its actions with its declared values on diversity and inclusion?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        The critique of panelists’ qualifications reveals elitism. <strong>How can SIGCSE work to value contributions from all educational roles and backgrounds?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        Reviewers’ emphasis on format over content suggests that <strong>SIGCSE needs to prioritize the impact and substance of proposals over their delivery method</strong>.
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        <strong>What actions can SIGCSE take to foster an environment where innovation and inclusion are paramount?</strong> The handling of Dr. Washington's proposal suggests barriers to innovation in CS education.
